!10,000 Maniacs - Girl On A Train

Waking on a train dreaming, 
Charmed alone they started speaking. 
Captured in his artist way, 
Before the memories fade away. 

To remember a face, 
And you're home or want to. 
Certain they would meet soon, 
Pain a portrait of a family. 

Single light on, single way, 
Single light away. 
The night fell. 
Saw a painting on the stairwell, 
To mouirn the passing of a daughter dear. 

Her soul upon the train 
So far, so near. 
Just close your eyes 
And you're home.

!10,000 Maniacs - City Of Angels

Heaven, is this heaven where we are? 
See them walkin', if you dare, if you call that walking. 
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves 
Along the streets of heaven. 

Where is the blessed table to feed all who hunger on earth, 
Welcomed and seated each one joyfully served? 
See them walking, if you dare, if you call that walking. 
Stumble, stagger, fall and drag themselves 
Along the streets of heaven. 

Where is the halo that should glow 'round your face, 
And where are the wings that should grow from your shoulder blades? 
Show them to me! 
These are sobering sights I've seen in the City of Angels 
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven. 

There would have been heavenly music I was convinced before. 
A host of the dearly to meet me with Hosannas sung at the door, 
But these are sobering sights I've seen in the City of Angels 
Have all been one rude awakening that was dues to me in heaven. 
In this city of Fallen Angels!

!10,000 Maniacs - A Campfire

A lie to say: "Oh, my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig. 
500 men with axes and they all dig for me." 
A lie to say: "Oh, my river where many fish do swim, 
Half of the catch is mine when you haul your nets in." 
Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding ray. 
No devil or redeemer will cheat him. 
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold. 

A lie to say: "Oh, my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist." 
But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed. 
A lie to say: "Oh, my garden is growing taller by the day." 
He only eats the best and tosses the rest away. 
Never will he be believe that his greed is a blinding ray. 
No devil or redeemer can cheat him. 
He'll take his gold to where he's lying cold. 
Six deep in the grave. 

Something is out of reach 
Something he wanted 
Something is out of reach 
He's being taunted 
Something is out of reach 
That he can't beg or steal 
Nor can he buy. 

His oldest pain 
And fear in life 
There'll not be time 
His oldest pain 
And fear in life 
There.ll not be time. 

A lie to say: "Oh, my forest has trees that block the sun 
And when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone." 
No, no, never will he believe that his greed is a blinding ray 
No devil or redeemer can cheat him. 
He'll take his gold where he's lying cold.

!Metallica - The Unforgiven

New blood joins this earth 
And quickly he's subdued 
Through constant pained disgrace 
The young boy learns their rules. 

With time the child draws in 
This whipping boy done wrong 
Deprived of all his thoughts 
The young man struggles on and on he's known 
A vow unto his own 
That never from this day 
His will they'll take away, hey. 

[Chorus:] 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never be 
Never see 
Won't see what might have been 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never free 
Never me 
So I dub thee unforgiven. 

They dedicate their lives 
To running all of his 
He tries to please them all 
This bitter man he is 
Throughout his life the same 
He's battled constantly 
This fight he cannot win 
A tired man they see no longer cares 
The old man then prepares 
To die regretfully 
That old man here is me. 

[Chorus:] 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never be 
Never see 
Won't see what might have been 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never free 
Never me 
So I dub thee unforgiven. 

[Chorus:] 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never be 
Never see 
Won't see what might have been 
What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never free 
Never me 
So I dub thee unforgiven. 

Whoa! Whoa! 

Never Free 
Never Me 
So I dub thee unforgiven! 
You labeled me 
I'll label you 
So I dub thee unforgiven! 
Never Free 
Never Me 
So I dub thee unforgiven! 
You labeled me 
I'll label you 
So I dub thee unforgiven! 
Never Free 
Never Me 
So I dub thee unforgiven!

!Metallica - Enter Sandman

Say your prayers little one 
Don`t forget my son 
To include everyone 
I tuck you in 
Walk within. 
Keep you free from sin 
Till the sandman he comes. 

Sleep with one eye open 
Gripping your pillow tight. 

Exit light 
Enter night 
Take my hand 
We're off to never never-land. 

Something's wrong, shut the light 
Heavy thoughts tonight 
And they aren't of Snow White 
Dreams of war 
Dreams of liars 
Dreams of dragons fire 
And of things that will bite. 

Yeah! 

Sleep with one eye open 
Gripping your pillow tight 

Exit light 
Enter night 
take my hand 
We're off to never never-land. 

Now I lay me down to sleep 
(Now I lay me down to sleep) 
Pray the lord my soul to keep 
(Pray the lord my soul to keep) 
If I die before I wake 
(If I die before I wake) 
Pray the lord my soul to take 
(Pray the lord my soul to take). 

Hush little baby don't say a word 
And never mind that noise you heard 
It's just the beasts under your bed 
In your closet and in your head. 

Exit light 
Enter night 
Grain of sand! 

Exit light 
Enter Night 
Take my hand! 
We're off to never never-land. 

Yeah, ha ha ha ... 

Boom! 

Yeah, yeah! 
Oh! Whoa! 

We're off to never never-land ... 

Take my hand 
(We're off to never never-land ...) 
Take my hand 
(We're off to never never-land ...) 

We're off to never never-land ...

!Metallica - Nothing Else Matters

So close no matter how far 
Couldn't be much more from the heart 
Forever trusting who we are 
And nothing else matters. 

Never opened myself this way 
Life is ours, we live it our way 
All these words I don't just say 
And nothing else matters. 

Trust I seek and I find in you 
Every day for us something new 
Open mind for a different view 
And nothing else matters. 

Never cared for what they do 
Never cared for what they know, 
But I know!

And I know! 

Yeah!

Couldn't be much more from the heart 
Forever trusting who we are 
No, nothing else matters ...

!Metallica - Astronomy

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst 
Out at you from their hiding place? 
Like acid and oil on a madman's face 
His reasons tend to fly away. 

Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah 
Like silver scrapes in May 
Now the sands become a crust 
And most of you have gone away... 

Yea, gone away. 

Ah, come Susie dear, let's take a walk 
Just out there upon the beach 
I know you'll soon be married 
And you'll want to know where winds come from. 

Well, it's never said at all 
On the map that Carrie reads 
Behind the clock back there you know 
At the four winds bar, mm, yeah! 

Yeah 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 

Four winds at the four winds bar 
Two doors locked, ten windows barred 
One door left to take you in 
The other one just mirrors it. 

Hey! 
Hey! 
Yeah! 
Hey! 
Yeah! 
Hey! 

Ooh, in hellish glare and inference 
The other one's a duplicate 
The queenly flux, eternal light 
Or the light that never warms 
Yes, the light that never, never warms 
Yes, the light that never, never warms 
Never warms, never warms ... 

The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst 
Out at you from their hiding place? 
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear 
Would find themselves at four winds bar. 

It's the nexus of the crisis 
And the origin of storms 
Just the place to hopelessly 
Encounter time and then came me. 

Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 

Call me Desdenova, eternal light 
These gravely digs of mine 
Will surely prove a sight 
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent. 

Astronomy - A Star! 
Astronomy - A Star! 
Astronomy (astronomy) - A Star, yeah! 
Astronomy - A Star!

!Metallica - Turn The Page

On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha 
You can listen to the engines moanin' Out its one note song 
You can think about the woman or the girl 
You knew the night before. 

But your thoughts will soon be wandering 
The way they always do 
When you're ridin' sixteen hours 
And there's nothin' much to do 
And you don't feel much like riding 
You just wish the trip was through. 

[Chorus:] 
Here I am, on the road again 
There I am, up on the stage 
There I go, playin' star again 
There I go, turn the page. 

So you walk into this restaurant 
Strung out from the road 
And you feel the eyes upon you 
As you're shaking off the cold 
You pretend it doesn't bother you 
But you just want to explode. 

And most times you can't hear 'em talk 
But other times you can 
All the same old cliches: 
"Is it woman? Is it man?" 
And you always seem outnumbered 
You don't dare make a stand... 

Make your stand! 

[Chorus:] 
Here I am, on the road again 
There I am, up on the stage 
Here I go, playn' star again 
There I go, turn the page. 

Whoa-Oh! 

Out there in the spotlight, 
You're a million miles away 
Every ounce of energy, 
You try and give away 
As the sweat pours out your body, 
Like the music that you play ... 

Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed 
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head 
You smoke the day's last cigarette 
Remembering what she said 
What she said. 

(Yeah, what she said) 

Yeah! 

[Chorus:] 
Here I am, on the road again 
There I am, up on the stage 
Here I go, playn' star again 
There I go, turn the page. 

And there I go, turn that page 
There I go, yeah 
Here I go, yeah! 
Here I go, yeah! 
Here I go, yeah! 
There I go, there I go 
(And I'm gone)

!Metallica - Tuesday's Gone

See, i'm riding my blues away 
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free 
But somehow, I've got you to carry on 
My Baby's gone! 

[Chorus:] 
Tuesday's gone with the wind 
Tuesday's gone, long gone with the wind 
Tuesday's gone with the wind 
My baby's gone with the wind.

!Metallica - Whiskey In The Jar

As I was going over the Cork and Kerry Mountains 
I saw Captain Farrell and his money, he was counting 
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier 
I said, "Stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya". 

I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny 
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly 
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me 
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy. 

[Chorus:] 
Musha rain dum a doo, dum a da 
Whack for my daddy, oh 
Whack for my daddy, oh 
There's whiskey in the jar, Oh! 

Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber 
Taking Molly with me but I never knew the danger 
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell 
I jumped up, fired my pistols and I shot him with both barrels. 

Yeah! 

[Chorus:]

Whack for my daddy, oh

There's whiskey in the jar, Oh! 

Yeah, whiskey, yo, whiskey 
Oh, oh, yeah 
Oh, oh, yeah! 

Now some men like a fishing but some men like the fowling 
Some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball roaring 
But me, I like sleeping, 'specially in my Molly's chamber 
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah! 

[Chorus:]

Auf wiedersehen 
It's time to say goodbye 
The party's over 
As the laughter dies 
An angel cries ... 

Humanity, 
It's au revoir to your insanity 
You sold your soul to feed your vanity 
Your fantasies and lies.

Just a number not a name 
And you don't see it

And now you gotta deal with it

For all the egotistic games you played 
The world you made 
Is gone.

!Пилот- Мы Есть ТО

Сердце, что бьётся в каждой груди, 
Светлая мира печаль, 
Радость улыбки рождения вновь, 
Смерти безграничная даль, 
Идущий в Пути, и Путь без начала, и цель достижения его – 
Мы есть ТО!
Крутит Игра по кругу волчок, 
И снова хвост кусает змея. 
Кем угодно себя в отражении видит 
Тот, кто не имеет лица. 
Альфа миров, Омега вселенных, 
Причина движения всего – 
Мы есть ТО!

Сотни тысяч «я» придут и уйдут, 
Смоет время отпечатки следов. 
Точка, в которой кружится ВСЁ- 
фокус Волшебника Снов. 
В мире нет двух, и каждый из нас 
Вокруг себя видит того, 
Кто есть ТО!


!Пилот - Человек и пёс

Мой поезд – сердце да холодный металл, 
Дороги колесами глотал. 
И что за странный вокзал, куда единственный дали билет? 
В моей улыбке ты не поймаешь ответ.
Кого ты посмеешь обвинить? 
Ты сам - шестерка и туз! Чем ты будешь крыть? 
Пара вечной любви, что в себе ты нес - 
Человек и пёс.

Мое оружие - слово, им можно убить и спасти. 
Из всех идущих по тропам, я - всегда в начале Пути. 
Меня не нужно искать, я везде, куда ступает нога: 
В урагане я - ветер, в костре – огонь, в реке – вода.


!Пилот - Звери

Голод сердца приносит ночи без сна, 
Битые стекла, да размытую тушь. 
Камень за камнем падут города. 
Что осталось тебе? - 
Ржавая в кружке вода. 
Что вам белые перья мои, вороны, 
Короли помоек, лорды мутных луж? 
Эхом зимних стуж о края Земли 
Мой кровавый хрип, 
брошенного камня круги.
Не смей закрывать в себе двери! 
Услышат позывной и придут наши звери. 
Тому, кто счастье нашел в этом мире – 
Нечего бояться, и можно идти в другие!

Как родился – уже бирка на руке, 
В метрике номер, и твой телефон. 
Что от мира сожрал – выблюешь во сне! 
Твоя задача – жрать, 
Размножаться и спать! 
Но маяк в груди всё горит свечой! 
И веки разомкнут, и отправятся в Путь. 
И расступается лес перед тропой, 
И с неё не свернуть, 
И нужно принимать бой!


!Пилот - Провожать

Стёкла на глаза. Спрячь улыбку свою. 
В списке прочерк - ты отсутствуешь в строю. 
На руках у тебя логин и пароль. 
Здесь останется только твоя боль. 
Дверь откроешь к ветрам пыль дорог собирать, 
И даже нет нужды тебя ждать, 
С ответом ждать. И только я 
Приду тебя провожать.
Вещи твои я раздам друзьям. 
Город, где ты теперь, 
Я придумаю сам. 
Тебя будут искать, 
Нападать на след, 
Но следы твои я запутал, 
Их нет. 
Никому не звони. 
Не прощайся ни с кем. 
Будет легче мне стереть тебя совсем. 
Людям всем придётся лгать, 
И тебя, как всех, провожать.

!Пилот - Один шаг

А как бы мне это 
Тебе рассказать? 
Смысл ответа 
В руки отдать? 
Страх одинаков – 
Что трус, что герой. 
Но первый сдаётся, 
Бой принимает второй!
Чтобы выброшенной на берег рыбой воздух не ловить, 
В реке единой Жизни научись без страха плыть. 
Точка начала… Ворота конца… 
Путь в тысячу ли начинается с шага неспроста. 
Глядя в глаза мне, сказал однажды старый маг: 
« Чтоб по воде пойти тебе нужен один…всего один шаг!»

Один в поле - воин, 
Если учесть, 
Что Небо с тобою, 
Небо там, где ты есть! 
Страшно решиться, 
Но кто, если не ты? 
Спокойной ночи 
Не желают в Пути!

Рыбы, гады, звери, птицы – все идут одним Путём, 
Если ты им - друг, то и тебе найдётся место в нём. 
Идею о войнах придумал ты сам, 
Но единственный враг внутри, и ты найдёшь вскоре его там. 
Глядя в глаза мне, сказал однажды старый маг: 
« Чтобы пойти в атаку, нужен один… всего один шаг!»


!Пилот - Наша сила

В условной уравниловке газетных фотографий 
развивается светобоязнь. Надень очки! 
Безнаказанно тогда расставляй свою сеть 
бандерлогам. 
Серые глаза замотаны бинтами, 
Зорко чувствуют природу того, что происходит - 
как худеющий февраль слабых духом за собою 
уводит.
Такие, как мы, не пересекаются! 
Таких, как мы, не выдашь на заказ! 
Наша сила в вас! 
Слышит ли кто-нибудь нас сейчас? 
Наша сила в вас!

Свинячий восторг и сиамские уши 
Дышат равномерно, задаваясь вопросом: 
Как по Великому Пределу прошагать 
и сохранить свои зубы?

Шизофрения и врач, свобода и тюрьма, 
как сука с кобелём унюхают друг друга за версту! 
Сила вздоха равна нулю, а я лежу и молчу!

Такие, как мы, не пересекаются! 
Таких, как мы, не выдашь на заказ! 
Наша сила в вас! 
Слышит ли кто-нибудь нас сейчас? 
Наша сила в вас!


!Пилот - Единожды Один

Солнце моё встает. Тени, по углам! 
Я стою здесь телом, душою где- то там... 
В птицах моя сила, в перьях заговор. 
Земля – моя перина, небо звёздное - шатёр.
Уши чуткие мышей, ворона глаза, 
Хищник – мои зубы, лёгкие – тайга. 
Дар волшебный травам исцеленья дан, 
Ярость пляшет молнией, слёзы – океан.

Ты такой же как я, и я такой же как ты, 
Да и между нами нет разницы! 
Между мной и тобой обманом вбитый клин, 
Единожды Один.

Не отмоешь черную псину до бела! 
Я, как Мастер Шахмат, играю сам в себя. 
И жизнь, как в чёрном море белый пароход - 
Двигаешь фигуры или пропускаешь ход.

Всё огонь очистит, и приведёт домой. 
Память моя в камнях, сложенных горой. 
И я во всех глазах и везде мои следы. 
Так где кончаюсь Я и начинаешься ТЫ?

И чтоб измерить нас нету величин. 
Я и ты - ОДИН.


!Пилот - Любовь, Истина и Свет

Ты смотришь на солнце, не отводя глаз. 
Значит, ты уже знаешь, что сейчас 
Не время думать, не время спать. 
Нет больше паузы тупо ждать 
От телевизора новых чудес, 
Где едва ли не каждый второй в грязь руками полез, 
где парашютными куполами 
Церкви охраняют людей от Небес.
То, что ты искал ночами, 
Сила всех иных планет:

Любовь, Истина и Свет!

Когда лжец принесёт тебе правду, 
Когда убийца согреет любовь, 
Когда шлюха почтит чистоту и верность, 
тогда приду я вновь. 
Когда судья попросит прощения, 
Когда клятвы потеряют вес, 
Когда вор раздаст своё добро, 
Я скажу за тебя, как за себя самого:

Любовь, Истина и Свет!

Своди меня с ума вопросами, да! 
Дыши ржавой струной столько лет, 
Насколько выдержит шаги вода, 
Сколь долго сможет промолчать пистолет! 
Умри, но знай, что не растают следы, 
Где плач – нетающие ада льды, 
Ничто вокруг себя не сможешь сберечь. 
Не ждет река берегов. Ей нужно течь!

Я пройду по дну Валгаллы, 
Зная лишь один секрет:

Любовь, Истина и Свет!


!Пилот - Ершалаим

Одной ногой на крыше, 
Другой в луже! 
Не зови - не услышу, я слился с небом, 
Лежу отравленный в углу.
Зовет меня кто-то. 
Уходит голос, разделился вчетверо 
И сгинул в зазеркалье, 
А в липких зассаных стенах система. 
Цирковая арена продана. 
Сломана жизнь, на куски разорвана.

Земля замкнулась в круге. 
На стенах тени. На полу трава, 
Она унесет тебя за край миров. 
Не нужно слов - я знаю где ты.

Куда несут крылья?! 
Зажгла в глазах твоих пожар 
Испуганная жизнь, 
А зубы в пене тонут! 
- "Контроль! 
Кровь ляжет в омут! 
Ты заблудился!" 
Привал... тот, кто тебя звал кричит: 
"Контроль!"

Что толку рвать когти?! 
Белее снега голова, и ты в порядке, 
Слегка безумен, правда. 
Хотел в небо - метко рухнул в костер! 
На черном флаге искры 
Зарей алой разожглись, 
Запутав стрелки, вселяя тварей в рай. 
В холодных мраморных стенах система. 
Цирковая арена продана. 
Светится бритый затылок Ершалаима.


!Пилот - ЧБ

Время искать себя самого 
Время искать пшеницу средь трав 
Время сжигать золотые мосты 
Время уходить если ты прав
Мнения масс, богатство и власть 
И запахи денег куют города 
Но светлый человек мне когда-то сказал: 
Чушь это всё! Всё - суета!

Чёрная земля, белые цветы 
Что на мой вопрос ответишь ты?

Кто все мы? Откуда идём? 
Кто светит нам в ночи фонарём? 
Из какого леса мы вышли? 
В какую дверь мы войдём?

Что наша жизнь? Где мы умрём? 
Что служит нам путеводным огнём? 
Где потеряли мы сердце? 
Где мы свободу найдём?

Чёрная земля станет углём. 
Белые цветы станут тобой. 
На стене часы пробьют "Подъем!". 
Разведёт стрелки часовой.

Тянется время в вагонах ЖД. 
Утро в постели не по нутру. 
Стало быть, будет шире наш шаг. 
Красным распишемся на белом снегу.

Чёрная земля, белые цветы... 
Что на мой вопрос ответишь ты?

Кто все мы? Откуда идём? 
Кто светит нам в ночи фонарём? 
Из какого леса мы вышли? 
В какую дверь мы войдём?

Что наша жизнь? Где мы умрём? 
Что служит нам путеводным огнём? 
Где потеряли мы сердце? 
Где мы свободу найдём?


!Пилот - Шнурок

Все незаконно хранимые секреты убегают, 
Оставляя мои двери, утекая через тысячи 
Замков. Утро штрих-кодом рубцов 
На левой руке подскажет мне,
Что наши сорванные быстро растрепались на ветру. 
По проводам, резонируя, уносится в твою квартиру 
Моё слово. Курим с тобой, 
А на руках замыкаются кольца рукой.

Два слова, строка, да шнурок с потолка 
Два слова, строка, да шнурок с потолка

Мне зуб на зуб не попадает, я от бешенства белею 
Каждый раз, и снова глухо на трамвайной 
Остановке, и пальцы ловки, 
И всё шире улыбки в местной ментовке.

А было б так просто докричаться до крови, 
Отхаркать и раздать своё сердце по куску 
На пироги. Гори, серая плесень, 
Дай встать моим, твой мир им так тесен.

Два слова, строка, да шнурок с потолка 
Два слова, строка, да шнурок с потолка

И будут дети в твою спину кидать свои снежки, 
Весь город, улыбаясь, будет слушать твои 
Звонки. Скоро ты станешь и сам 
Перебегать кривыми по чужим адресам.

Я, как и ты, думал что за нами прилетят, 
Ошейник снимут, за ухом почешут 
И всё простят. Но я сплю у миски, 
И ты всё съел, в подарок ириска.

Два слова, строка, да шнурок с потолка 
Верному псу шнурок с потолка...


!Пилот - Нет вестей с небес

Нет вестей с небес, да в моём стакане 
Водка - жизни боль, да на сердце шрам. 
Сколь ещё снести колотых, нежданных 
Я смогу, покуда душу не продам? 
Если слышишь ты песню эту, друже, 
Молча «пятьдесят» опрокинь со мной. 
Взяв себе билет с вокзала до конечной, 
Проведём с тобою всю жизнь по поездам!
К чёрту ту весну, на хер это небо, 
Если волчий вой рвётся изнутри, 
И стучат в груди, захлопываясь, двери! 
К пропасти в дороге попутчиков не жди.

А в моём окне люди да машины. 
И кто из них кто – пёс их разберёт! 
Поженилась в них кровь живая с нефтью, 
Да всё судьба их, дура, носит в сердце лёд. 
И не горюй, братан, не горюй, сестричка, 
Что радости огонь в нас перегорел. 
Нам сияние звёзд светит ярче солнца. 
И всё, чего прошу я - взять никто не смел!

И держит нас капкан за ноги петлёю! 
И некуда лететь, нас нигде не ждут! 
Петь среди собак волчьи наши песни, 
Где с небес за нами так и не придут!


!Elvis Presley - Are You Lonesome Tonight?

Are You Lonesome Tonight? 
Do you miss me tonight? 
Are you sorry we drifted apart? 
Does your memory stray 
To a bright summer day 
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? 
Do you gaze at your doorstep 
And picture me there? 
Is your heart filled with pain, 
Shall I come back again? 
Tell me, dear, Are You Lonesome Tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight 
You know someone said that the world's a stage 
And we each must play a part. 
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart.

Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance 
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue 
Then came act 2, you seemed to change, you acted strange 
And why I've never known.

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me 
And I had no cause to doubt you. 
But I'd really go on hearing your lies 
Than to go on living without you.

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there 
With emptiness all around 
And if you won't come back to me 
Then they can bring the curtain down.

Is your heart filled with pain? 
Shall I come back again? 
Tell me, dear, Are You Lonesome Tonight?


!Elvis Presley - Pretty Woman

Pretty woman, walking down the street 
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet 
Pretty woman! 
I don't believe you, you're not the truth 
No one could look as good as you.
Mercy!

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me 
Pretty woman, I couldn't help see 
Pretty woman 
That you look lovely as can be 
Are you lonely just like me.

Wow!

Pretty woman, stop a while 
Pretty woman, talk a while 
Pretty woman, give your smile to me 
Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah 
Pretty woman, look my way 
Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.

'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right 
Come with me baby, be mine tonight.

Pretty woman, don't walk on by 
Pretty woman, don't make me cry 
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey... okay.

If that's the way it must be, okay 
I guess I'll go on home, it's late 
There'll be tomorrow nigh, but wait 
What do I see?

Is she walking back to me 
Yeah, she's walking back to me 
Oh, oh! 
Pretty woman!

!Elvis Presley - Only You

Only you can to make all this wealth seem bright, 
Only you can to make the darkness bright, 
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do, 
And to fill my heart with love for only you.
Only you can to make all this change in me, 
For it’s true - you are my destiny. 
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do 
You’re my dream come true, my one and only you.

!Elvis Presley - Can't Help Falling In Love

Wise men say 
Only fools rush in 
But I can't help 
Falling in love with you.
Shall I stay? 
Would it be a sin? 
If I can't help 
Falling in love with you.

Like a river flows 
Surely to the sea 
Darling so it goes 
Some things are meant to be...

Take my hand, 
Take my whole life, too 
For I can't help 
Falling in love with you.

Like a river flows

You fooled me with your kisses 
You cheated and you schemed

But I was sure surprised

!Мамульки Бенд - Ветер

Горе стряслось - беда 
Снова душа томится 
Как же могло тогда 
Так получиться
Ящик почтовый пуст 
Снова молчит мобильник 
В сердце обиды груз 
Давит так сильно

Ветер, высуши глаза 
Печальные мои 
Отказали тормоза 
У моей любви 
Что мне делать, как мне быть 
Ой, не знаю я 
Как же мне тебя забыть 
Любимая...

С горя напился вчера 
Пивом и горькой водки 
Ну а сегодня с утра 
Встал такой четкий

Еле глаза открыл 
Зубы почистил мечтою 
Я ведь почти забыл 
Как хорошо мне с тобою

Ветер, высуши глаза 
Печальные мои 
Отказали тормоза 
У моей любви 
Что мне делать, как мне быть 
Ой, не знаю я 
Как же мне тебя забыть

!Scorpions - Still Loving You

Time, it needs time 
To win back your love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, only love 
Can bring back your love someday 
I will be there, I will be there.
I'll fight, babe, I'll fight 
To win back your love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, only love 
Can break down the walls someday 
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Your pride has built a wall so strong 
That I can't get through 
Is there really no chance 
To start once again 
I'm loving you.

Try, baby, try 
To trust in my love again 
I will be there, I will be there 
Love, our love 
Just shouldn't be thrown away 
I will be there, I will be there.

If we'd go again 
All the way from the start

To start once again.

If we'd go again 
All the way from the start 
I would try to change 
The things that killed our love 
Yes, I've hurt your pride and I know 
What you've been through 
You should give me a chance 
This can't be the end 
I'm still loving you 
I'm still loving, I need your love 
I'm still loving you.


!Scorpions - Send Me An Angel

The wise man said just walk this way 
To the dawn of the light 
The wind will blow into your face 
As the years pass you by.
Hear this voice from deep inside 
It's the call of your heart 
Close your eyes and your will find 
The passage out of the dark.

[Chorus:] 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star.

The wise man said just find your place 
In the eye of the storm 
Seek the roses along the way 
Just beware of the thorns.

[Chorus:] 
Here I am 
Will you send me an angel 
Here I am 
In the land of the morning star.

The wise man said just raise your hand 
And reach out for the spell 
Find the door to the promised land 
Just believe in yourself.

Hear this voice from deep inside 
It's the call of your heart 
Close your eyes and your will find 
The way out of the dark.

!Scorpions - Always Somewhere

Arrive at seven the place feels good 
No time to call you today 
Encores till eleven Chinese then food 
Back to the hotel again.
I call your number the line ain't free 
I like to tell you come to me 
A night without you, seems like a lost dream 
Love I can't tell you how i feel.

[Chorus:] 
Always somewhere 
Miss you where i've been 
I'll be back to love you again.

[Chorus:] 
Always somewhere 
Miss you where i've been

The only day off is far away 
But every city has, seen me in the end 
And brings me to you again.

Always somewhere 
Miss you where i've been 
I'll be back to love you again.

Always somewhere

!Пара Нормальных - Happy End

Нарисую мелом, напишу: 
«I love you». 
Два сценария одной судьбы, 
Разный взгляд и цвет одной игры.
Напишу о том, что ты ушла, 
Но вернулась вскоре навсегда. 
Ты же рисовала на открытках 
Двери для меня, что впредь закрыты.

[Chorus:] 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end. 
Поверну всё так, чтоб два сердца вновь бились в такт. 
Всё ведь как в кино, разреши лишь доснять его. 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end!

Ты же знаешь всё исправить можно, 
Зачеркнуть, переписать обложку, 
Переснять все сцены, монологи 
Из сюжетов вычеркнуть так много…

Декорации сменить на осень 
О локациях никто не спросит. 
Разреши мне сделать это тайно, 
Чтоб все получилось, как случайно.

[Chorus:] 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end 
Поверну всё так, чтоб два сердца вновь бились в такт. 
Всё ведь как в кино, разреши лишь доснять его. 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end!

[Chorus:] 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end 
Поверну всё так, чтоб два сердца вновь бились в такт. 
Всё ведь как в кино, разреши лишь доснять его. 
Не пиши «The end», я придумаю Happy end!

!Gwen Stefani - Early Winter

You, you know how to get me so low 
My heart had a crash when we spoke 
I can't fix what you broke.
And you, you always have a reason 
Again and again this feelin' 
Why do I give in?

And I always was, 
Always was one for crying 
I always was one for tears.

[Chorus:] 
The sun's getting cold, It's snowing 
Looks like an Early Winter for us, 
Looks like an Early Winter for us 
An Early Winter 
Oh I need you to turn me over.

It's sad the map of the world is on you 
The moon gravitates around you 
The seasons escape you.

And I always was, 
Always was one for crying 
I always was one for tears.

No, I never was, never was one for lying 
You lied to me all of these years.

[Chorus:] 
The sun's getting cold, It's snowing 
Looks like an Early Winter for us, 
Looks like an Early Winter for us. 
An Early Winter 
Oh I need you to turn me over.

Why? 
Why do you act so stupid? 
Why? 
You know that I'm always right.

It looks like an Early Winter for us, 
It hurts and I can't remember sunlight. 
An Early Winter for us, 
The leaves are changing colour for us.

And it gets too much, yeah it gets so much 
Starting over and over and over again 
And it gets too much, yeah it gets so much 
Starting over and over and over again 
And it gets too much, yeah it gets so much 
It looks like an Early Winter for us ...


!Gwen Stefani - The Sweet Escape

[Gwen] 
If I could escape I would but, 
First of all, let me say

Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor 
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator 
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

If I could escape & recreate a place that's my own world 
And I could be your favourite girl (forever), Perfectly together 
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape) 
If I could be sweet, I know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)

[Akon] 
I want to get away, to our sweet escape

You held me down, I'm at my lowest boiling point 
Come help me out, I need to get me out of this joint 
Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around 
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground 
So baby, times get a little crazy 
I've been gettin' a little lazy, waitin' on you to come save me 
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me 
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanted you with me.

!No Doubt - Rock Steady

Our love is rock steady 
Rock steady. 
Rock steady, 
Rock steady ...
Our love is rock steady. 
Rock steady.

Love is like a punishment 
Homegirl here to represent 
So innocently you seem to come my way 
While Tinkerbell and Cupid play.

They sit there and laugh 
I sit here and I can't believe my eyes 
You found me at last 
But wait and see how it'll agonize.

[Chorus:] 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe.

Rock steady, rock steady 
Our love is so rock steady. 
Rock steady...

Steady now, stop rocking it 
It's a delicate environment 
Retire the sleeping is a Shanti love 
Be careful now don't wake it up.

It's never gonna last 
It's never gonna make it back alive 
So how can we relax 
I really hope that we will actually survive.

[Chorus:] 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe.

It's never gonna last 
It's never gonna makes it back alive

[Chorus:] 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe 
A real love survives a rock steady vibe.

Rock steady, 
Our love is so rock steady 
Rock steady,

!No Doubt - In My Head

I tried to think about rainbows 
When it gets bad 
You got to think about something 
To keep from going mad.
I tried to think about big fat roses 
When the ship starts going down 
But my head is wicked jealous 
Don't want to talk about it right now.

Long distance 
Don't talk about ex-girlfriends 
Don't talk about you with out me 
Don't talk about your past.

[Chorus:] 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head) 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head).

There's just something about you 
That gets me in a twist 
And sometimes I think 
That cupid is just taking a piss.

It only takes one word or idea 
To send me in real deep 
So if you think you're clever 
Use the right words when you talk to me.

Long distance 
Don't talk about ex-girlfriends 
Don't talk about you with out me 
Don't talk about your past.

[Chorus:] 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head) 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head).

[Chorus:] 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head) 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head).

I really think I have a problem 
I really can't control myself 
Why do I get so suspicious? 
Do you want someone else?

Cause everybody wants everybody else 
Everybody wants everybody else 
Everybody wants everybody else. 
Everybody wants everybody else!

Only in my head... 
It's only my head.

[Chorus:] 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head) 
In my head 
It's only in my head (Only in my head).

Long distance 
Don't talk about ex-girlfriends 
Don't talk about you with out me 
Don't talk about your past.

Lets talk about the future 
Lets talk about the wedding 
Lets talk about Gwen Stefani 
Let's talk about how much you like me

And all that ...


!Юрий Черкашин - Женщина в белом

Что-то в космосе нашем случилось, не знаю пока 
Загрустил мой пророк, на вопросы не знает ответов. 
Наши самые лучшие дни затерялись в веках 
И вернуть их нам не суждено по всем верным приметам.
По окну растекаются кляксами капли дождя, 
И дрожат светофора глаза на стекле акварелью, 
Я прошу, промолчи, я прошу, промолчи, уходя, 
Переждём эту осень и встретимся снежной метелью.

[Chorus:] 
Песня лета умолкла, 
Остановка осиротела, 
Разбросала рябина алые кисти. 
Ах, как долго, как долго 
Идёт эта женщина в белом 
Сквозь, парящие в дымке, жёлтые листья. 
Ах, как долго, как долго 
Идёт эта женщина в белом 
Сквозь, парящие в дымке, жёлтые листья.

Наш автобус уехал из города радостных встреч 
И безоблачных солнечных дней, и чудес ожиданья. 
А приехал в страну холодов. Нам тепло не сберечь. 
Мы застыли в раздумье - и как оттянуть миг прощанья?

Только окна домов почему-то так грустно глядят, 
И смешалась слеза с уходящим воскресным весельем. 
Я прошу, промолчи, я прошу, промолчи, уходя, 
Переждём эту осень и встретимся снежной метелью.

[Chorus:] 
Песня лета умолкла, 
Остановка осиротела, 
Разбросала рябина алые кисти. 
Ах, как долго, как долго 
Идёт эта женщина в белом 
Сквозь, парящие в дымке, жёлтые листья. 
Ах, как долго, как долго 
Идёт эта женщина в белом 
Сквозь, парящие в дымке, жёлтые листья.

Ах, как долго, как долго 
Идёт эта женщина в белом 
Сквозь, парящие в дымке, жёлтые листья.

!No Doubt - Start The Fire

C'mon baby get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire.
The army of words is in me 
Silent the soldier weeps 
Lying here back to back 
Waiting for you to be react.

Sometimes all I need is a good push 
Roll over and whisper some goodness 
Go on baby you be the hero 
Now can we go back to zero.

[Chorus:] 
Go on and get the lighter 
We're gonna need some fire 
Let's get a little higher 
The battlefield is tired 
And why all that? 
Go on baby and get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire.

Just come here and cuddle up 
I feel a little rough 
I missed you in my sleep 
Are you still mad at me?

The moon must have mended my bad mood 
Come kiss me the way you're meant to 
Last night I was just playing 
Let's put it all away and.

[Chorus:] 
Go on and get the lighter 
We're gonna need some fire 
Let's get a little higher 
The battlefield is tired 
And why all that? 
Go on baby and get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire.

Go on baby and get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire 
Go on baby and get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire.

Climb in, love with me 
Climb in and love me 
Go on now baby you get it.

Had quite a heavy night 
So girl look it all up and bright 
The most stubborn girl around 
You really know how to bring me down 
One more famous night to remember 
Let's laugh at my silly temper 
Now let's spend the morning sweetly 
Get over here and complete me.

[Chorus:] 
Go on and get the lighter 
We're gonna need some fire 
Let's get a little higher 
The battlefield is tired 
And why all that? 
Go on baby and get the lighter 
We're gonna start the fire.

Go on now baby you get it!


!No Doubt - Don't Let Me Down

Laughing so hard 
I got tears in my eyes 
Walk in the park 
Under sapphire skies.
Oh, I can't believe 
That you're still around 
Almost forgot 
How you let me down.

Crying so deep 
That I think I might die 
Your mistakes I keep 
In the back of my mind.

So hard to let go 
But I'm comin' round 
The scars are still fragile 
Don't let me down.

[CHORUS:] 
So don't blow it 
No not a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it 
Don't blow it 
Even a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it.

(Don't let me down) 
(Don't let me down) 
(Don't let me down).

Time after time 
It's just too much to take 
I've waited so long 
Just to get to this place.

And finally it feels like 
The lost was found 
You got me filled up now 
Don't let me down.

(Don't let me down)

[CHORUS:] 
So don't blow it 
No not a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it 
Don't blow it 
Even a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it.

[CHORUS:] 
So don't blow it 
No not a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it 
Don't blow it 
Even a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it.

(Don't let me down)

[CHORUS:] 
So don't blow it 
No not a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it 
Don't blow it 
Even a little bit 
Cause now you're all mine 
Don't you forget it.

[CHORUS:]

!No Doubt - Detective

Peek in, sneak about 
Peek in, sneak about 
Peek in, sneak about 
Your broken hearted detective.
Hey girl save the liar 
Can't you see his pants on fire 
Hey girl, save the liar 
Can't you see his pants on fire.

My back it hurts again 
It aches like history 
Caught nothing all day long 
Your smiling back at me, but.

I feel you must have failed me 
Once again you've let me down 
My confidence below my knees 
Now I need to find you out.

[Chorus:] 
Peek in, sneak about 
I'm gonna snoop and call you out 
I've caught you, you're hands are red 
Now I'm your broken hearted detective.

Hey, hey hey!

Hey lover why you gone? 
Hold on I'm almost there 
It's too late you've killed the trust 
Don't act so unaware.

Why are you so destructive? 
Do you realize what you've done? 
you can't bring it back to life now 
What are you running from?

[Chorus:] 
Peek in, sneak about 
I'm gonna snoop and call you out 
I've caught you, you're hands are red 
Now I'm your broken hearted detective.

I don't like the way it feels 
I just want you to be real.

Hey girl, save the liar 
Can't you see his pants on fire? 
Hey girl, save the liar 
Can't you see his pants on fire? 
I'm rummaging through your closet 
Imagining all the worst thoughts.

[Chorus:] 
Peek in, sneak about 
I'm gonna snoop and call you out 
I've caught you, you're hands are red 
Now I'm your broken hearted detective.

!No Doubt - Underneath It All

There's times where I want something more 
Someone more like me 
There's times when this dress rehearsal 
Seems incomplete.
But, you see the colors in me like no one else 
And behind your dark glasses you're ... 
You're something else.

[Chorus:] 
You're really lovely 
Underneath it all 
You want to love me 
Underneath it all 
I'm really lucky 
Underneath it all 
You're really lovely.

You know some real bad tricks 
And you need some discipline 
But, lately you've been trying real hard 
And giving me your best.

And, you give me the most gorgeous sleep 
That I've ever had 
And when it's really bad 
I guess it's not that bad.

[Chorus:] 
You're really lovely 
Underneath it all 
You want to love me 
Underneath it all 
I'm really lucky 
Underneath it all 
You're really lovely.

So many moons that we have seen 
Stumbling back next to me 
I've seen right through and underneath 
And you make me better.

I've seen right through and underneath 
And you make me better 
Better... better...

[Lady Saw:] 
You are my real Prince Charmin' 
Like the heat from the fire 
You were always burnin' 
And each time you're around 
My body keeps stalin' 
For your touch 
Your kisses and your sweet romancin' 
There's an underside to you 
That so many adore 
Aside from your temper 
Everything else secure 
You're good for me, baby 
Oh that, I'm sure 
Over and over again 
I want more.

[Gwen:] 
You've used up all your coupons 
And all you've got left is me 
And somehow I'm full of forgiveness 
I guess it's meant to be.

[Chorus:] 
You're really lovely 
Underneath it all 
You want to love me 
Underneath it all 
I'm really lucky 
Underneath it all 
You're really lovely.

[Chorus:] 
You're really lovely 
Underneath it all 
You want to love me 
Underneath it all 
I'm really lovely 
Underneath it all 
And you're really lovely.

Mmm ... 
Mmm ... 
Mmm ...

Underneath it all.

Mmm ... 
Mmm ... 
Mmm ...

Underneath it all.

Mmm ... 
Mmm ... 
Mmm ...

Underneath it all.

Mmm ... 
Mmm ... 
Mmm ...

Underneath it all.


!No Doubt - Making Out

Yeah...
I'm on the second floor with a lock on my door 
I'm looking at a picture of your face 
The last time I looked you were looking really good 
But somehow pictures fade.

Then we're on the phone and we're all alone 
But that just ain't good enough 
I go around the world to see your face 
'Cause this just ain't good enough.

[Chorus:] 
So I'm just kicking it 
I'm counting the days 
I hardly can wait 
For us to hang out 
I'm really missing it 
In so many ways 
I anticipate us making out.

(Here comes another one).

Sip my morning tea but you're not next to me 
Here goes another day 
I'm driving in my car 
I wonder how you are 
When our favorite music plays.

And there are flowers above to my surprise 
But that just ain't good enough 
And I got the note 
It gave me hope 
But that just ain't good enough.

[Chorus:] 
So I'm just kicking it 
I'm counting the days 
I hardly can wait 
For us to hang out 
I'm really missing it in so many ways 
I anticipate us making out.

[Chorus:] 
So I'm just kicking it 
I'm counting the days 
I hardly can wait 
For us to hang out 
I'm really missing it in so many ways 
I anticipate us making out.

Yeah ...

Ooh oohh! 
Ooh oohh! 
Ooh oohh!

Soon you'll be here with me (making out...) 
Soon you'll be right here with me.

I'm with my friends 'till the night ends 
But that just ain't good enough 
And honestly you can trust me 
But that just ain't good enough.

[Chorus:] 
So I'm just kicking it 
I'm counting the days 
I hardly can wait for us to hang out 
I'm really missing it in so many ways 
I anticipate us making out.

[Chorus:] 
So I'm just kicking it 
I'm counting the days 
I hardly can wait for us to hang out 
I'm really missing it in so many ways 
I anticipate us making out.

Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes 
Takin it in, try to be feminine 
With my makeup bag watchin all the sin.

Misfit, I sit 
Lit up, wicked 
Everybody else surrounded by the girls 
With the tank tops and the flirty ways.

Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal 
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom 
And went to my high school.

And you can tell your friends how you made it back.

Somehow everybody knows my name 
And all the girls wanna get with the boys 
And the boys really like it.

!Linkin Park - What I've Done

In this farewell 
There's no blood 
There's no alibi 
Cause i've drawn regret 
From the truth 
Of a thousand lies.
So let mercy come 
And wash away.

[Chorus:] 
What i've done! 
I'll face myself 
To cross out what i've become 
Erase myself 
And let go of what i've done!

Put to rest 
What you thought of me 
While i've cleaned this slate 
With the hands 
Of uncertainty.

So let mercy come 
And wash away.

[Chorus:] 
What i've done! 
I'll face myself 
To cross out what i've become 
Erase myself 
And let go of what i've done!

For what i've done 
I start again 
And whatever pain may come 
Today this ends 
I'm forgiving what i've done!

[Chorus:] 
I'll face myself 
To cross out what i've become 
Erase myself 
And let go of what i've done!

What i've done! 
Forgiving what i've done!


!Linkin Park - Valentine's Day

My insides all turned to ash, so slow 
And blew away as i collapsed, so cold 
A black wind took them away, from sight 
And held the darkness over day, that night.
And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing.

I used to be my own protection, but not now 
Cause my path had lost direction, somehow 
A black wind took you away, from sight 
And held the darkness over day, that night.

And the clouds above move closer 
Looking so dissatisfied 
And the ground below grew colder 
As they put you down inside 
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing.

So now you're gone 
And i was wrong 
I never knew what it was like 
To be alone 
On a valentine's day.

On a valentine's day! 
On a valentine's day! 
On a valentine's day! 
On a valentine's day! 
On a valentine's day!

On a valentine's day! 
(I used to be my own protection) 
On a valentine's day! 
(But not now ...) 
On a valentine's day! 
(Cause my mind had lost direction) 
On a valentine's day! 
(Ssomehow ...)

On a valentine's day! 
(I used to be my own protection) 
On a valentine's day! 
(But not now ...) 
On a valentine's day! 
(Cause my mind had lost direction) 
On a valentine's day! 
(Ssomehow ...)


!Linkin Park - The Little Things Give You Away

Water grey 
Through the windows 
Up the stairs 
Chilling rain 
Like an ocean 
Everywhere.
[Chorus:] 
Don't want to reach for me do you 
I mean nothing to you 
The little things give you away 
And now there will be no mistaking 
The levees are breaking.

All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet, underwater 
I do.

Hope decays 
Generations disappear 
Washed away 
As a nation simply stares.

[Chorus:] 
Don't want to reach for me do you 
I mean nothing to you 
The little things give you away 
But now there will be no mistaking 
The levees are breaking.

All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet, underwater 
I do.

All you've ever wanted 
Was someone to truly look up to you 
And six feet, underground now 
I do.

The little things give you away.


!Linkin Park - Shadow of the Day

I close both locks below the window 
I close both blinds and turn away 
Sometimes solutions aren't so simple 
Sometimes goodbye's the only way.
[Chorus:] 
And the sun will set for you 
The sun will set for you 
And the shadow of the day 
Will embrace the world in grey 
And the sun will set for you.

In cards and flowers on your window 
Your friends all plead for you to stay 
Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple 
Sometimes goodbye's the only way.

[Chorus:] 
And the sun will set for you 
The sun will set for you 
And the shadow of the day 
Will embrace the world in grey 
And the sun will set for you.

And the shadow after day 
Will embrace the world in grey 
And the sun will set for you.

And the shadow after day 
Will embrace the world in grey 
And the sun will set for you.


!Linkin Park - No Roads Left

Standing alone with no direction 
How did I fall so far behind? 
Why Am I searching for perfection? 
Knowing it's something I won't find.
In my fear and flaws 
I let myself down again 
All because.

[Chorus:] 
I run 
Till the silence splits me open 
I run 
Till it puts me underground 
Till I have no breath 
And no roads left but one.

When did I lose my sense of purpose? 
Can I regain what's lost inside? 
Why do I feel like I deserve this? 
Why does my pain look like my pride?

In my fear and flaws 
I let myself down again 
All because 
I let myself down 
In my fear and flaws.

[Chorus:] 
I run 
Till the silence splits me open 
I run 
Till it puts me underground 
Till I have no breath 
And no roads left but one 
No roads left but one.

In my fear and flaws 
I let myself down again 
All because.

I run 
And the silence splits me open 
I run 
And it puts me underground 
But there's no regret 
And no roads left to run.


!Linkin Park - No More Sorrow

Are you lost? In your lies? 
Do you tell yourself i don't realize 
Your campaign's a disguise 
Replaced freedom with fear, 
You trade money for lives 
I'm aware of what you've done.
[Chorus:] 
No! No more sorrow! 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced.

I see pain. I see need 
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed 
I had hope! I believed! 
But i'm beginning to think that i've been deceived 
You will pay for what you've done.

[Chorus:] 
No! No more sorrow! 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced.

Thieves and hypocrites. 
Thieves and hypocrites. 
Thieves and hypocrites!

[Chorus:] 
No! No more sorrow! 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced.

[Chorus:] 
No! No more sorrow! 
I've paid for your mistakes 
Your time is borrowed 
Your time has come to be replaced.

Your time has come to be ... 
Your time has come to be erased.


!Linkin Park - Leave Out All The Rest

I dreamed i was missing 
You were so scared 
But no one would listen 
Cause no one else cared.
After my dreaming 
I woke with this fear 
What am i leaving 
When i'm done here.

So if you're asking me i want you to know.

[Chorus:] 
When my time comes 
Forget the wrong that i've done 
Help me leave behind some 
Reasons to be missed 
Don't resent me 
And when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory 
Leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest.

Don't be afraid 
I've taken my beating 
I've shared what i made.

I'm strong on the surface 
Not all the way through 
I've never been perfect 
But neither have you.

So if you're asking me i want you to know.

[Chorus:] 
When my time comes 
Forget the wrong that i've done 
Help me leave behind some 
Reasons to be missed 
Don't resent me 
And when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory 
Leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest.

Forgetting! 
All the hurt inside you learned to hide so well 
Pretending! 
Someone else can come and save me from myself 
I can't be who you are.

[Chorus:] 
When my time comes 
Forget the wrong that i've done 
Help me leave behind some 
Reasons to be missed. 
Don't resent me 
And when you're feeling empty 
Keep me in your memory 
Leave out all the rest 
Leave out all the rest.

Forgetting! 
All the hurt inside you learned to hide so well 
Pretending! 
Someone else can come and save me from myself 
I can't be who you are.

I can't be who you are ...


!Linkin Park - In Pieces

Telling me to go 
But hands beg me to stay 
Your lips say that you love 
Your eyes say that you hate.
There's truth in your lies 
Doubt in your faith 
What you build you lay to waste 
There's truth in your lies 
Doubt in your faith 
All i've got's what you didn't take.

[Chorus:] 
So i ... I wont be the one 
Be the one to leave this 
In pieces 
And you ... you will be alone 
Alone with all your secrets 
Your regrets 
Don't lie.

You promise me the sky 
Then toss me like a stone 
You wrap me in your arms 
And chill me to the bone.

There's truth in your lies 
And doubt in your faith 
All i've got's what you didn't take.

[Chorus:] 
So i ... I wont be the one 
Be the one to leave this 
In pieces 
And you ... you will be alone 
Alone with all your secrets 
Your regrets 
Don't lie.

[Chorus:] 
So i ... I wont be the one 
Be the one to leave this 
In pieces 
And you ... you will be alone 
Alone with all your secrets 
And regrets 
Don't lie.

!Linkin Park - In Between

Let me apologize to begin with 
Let me apologize for what i'm about to say 
But trying to be genuine 
Was harder than it seemed 
And somehow i got caught up in between.
Let me apologize to begin with 
Let me apologize for what i'm about to say 
But trying to be someone else 
Was harder than it seemed 
And somehow i got caught up in between.

[Chorus:] 
Between my pride and my promise 
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way 
The things i want to say to you 
Get lost before they come 
The only thing that's worse than one is none.

Let me apologize to begin with 
Let me apologize for what i'm about to say 
But trying to regain your trust 
Was harder than it seemed 
And somehow i got caught up in between.

[Chorus:] 
Between my pride and my promise 
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way 
The things i want to say to you 
Get lost before they come 
The only thing that's worse than one is none.

The only thing that's worse than one is none.

And i cannot explain to you 
In anything i say or do or plan 
Fear is not afraid of you 
But guilt's a language you can understand 
I cannot explain to you 
In anything i say or do 
But hope the actions speak the words they can.

For my pride and my promise 
For my lies and how the truth gets in the way 
The things i want to say to you 
Get lost before they come 
The only thing that's worse than one is none.

[Chorus:] 
Between my pride and my promise 
Between my lies and how the truth gets in the way 
The things i want to say to you 
Get lost before they come 
The only thing that's worse than one is none.

The only thing that's worse than one is none. 
The only thing that's worse than one is none.


!Linkin Park - Hands Held High

Turn my mic up louder i got to say something 
Lightweights step it aside when we come in 
Feel it in your chest, the syllables get pumping 
People on the street they panic and start running.
Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming 
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme i'm dumping 
Healing the blind i promise to let the sun in 
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drum and.

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping 
Fuck that! I wanna see some fists pumping 
Risk something, take back what's yours 
Say something that you know they might attack you for.

Cause i'm sick of being treated like i have before 
Like it's stupid standing for what i'm standing for 
Like this war's really just a different brand of war 
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor.

Like they understand you in the back of the jet 
When you can't put gas in your tank, and these fuckers are 
Laughing their way to the bank, cashing the check 
Asking you to have compassion, have respect.

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way 
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay 
And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day 
In their living room laughing like 
What did he say?

In my living room watching, i am not laughing 
Cause when it gets tense i know what might happen 
The world is cold, the bold men make action 
Have to react or get blown into fractions.

Ten years old, it's something to see, another 
Kid my age drug under a jeep 
Taken and bound, and found later under a tree 
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me.

Do you see, the soldiers, they're out today they 
Brush the dust from bulletproof vests away 
It's ironic, at times like this you pray 
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday.

There's bombs on the busses, bikes, roads 
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes, my dad 
He's got a lot of fear i know 
But enough pride inside not to let that show.

My brother had a book he would hold with pride 
A little red cover with a broken spine 
On the back, he hand wrote a quote inside: 
'When the rich wage war it's the poor who die.

And meanwhile, the leader just talks away 
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay 
The rest of the world watching at the end of the day 
Both scared and angry like 
What did he say?

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.

With hands held high into a sky so blue 
As the ocean opens up to swallow you.


!Linkin Park - Given Up

Wake in a sweat again 
Another day's been laid to waste 
In my disgrace 
Stuck in my head again 
Feels like i'll never leave this place 
There's no escape 
I'm my own worst enemy.
[Chorus:] 
I've given up 
I'm sick of living 
Is there nothing you can say 
Take this all away 
I'm suffocating 
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.

I don't know what to take 
Thought i was focused but i'm scared 
I'm not prepared 
I hyperventilate 
Looking for help somehow somewhere 
And you don't care 
I'm my own worst enemy.

[Chorus:] 
I've given up 
I'm sick of living 
Is there nothing you can say 
Take this all away 
I'm suffocating 
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.

God!!!

Put me out of my misery! 
Put me out of my misery! 
Put me out of my ... 
Put me out of my ...

Fucking misery!

[Chorus:] 
I've given up 
I'm sick of living 
Is there nothing you can say 
Take this all away 
I'm suffocating 
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me.


!Linkin Park - Bleed It Out

Here we go for the hundredth time 
Hand grenade pins in every line 
Throw 'em up and let something shine 
Going out of my fuckin mind.
Filthy mouth, no excuse 
Find a new place to hang this noose 
String me up from atop these roofs 
Knot it tight so i won't get loose.

Truth is, you can stop and stare 
Bled myself out and no one cares 
Dug the trench out / laid down there 
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere.

Yeah! Someone pour it in 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in.

[Chorus:] 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
I bleed it out.

I bleed it out, go, stop the show 
Choppy words and a sloppy flow 
Shotgun opera, lock and load 
Cock it back and then watch it go.

Mama help me, i've been cursed 
Death is rolling in every verse 
Candy paint on his brand new hearse 
Can't contain him, he knows he works.

Fuck this hurts, i won't lie, 
Doesn't matter how hard i try 
Half the words don't mean a thing and i know i 
Won't be satisfied.

So why try ignoring him 
Make it a dirt dance floor again 
Say your prayers and stomp it out 
When they bring that chorus in.

[Chorus:] 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
I bleed it out.

I open up these scars 
I'll make you face this 
I pull myself apart 
I'll make you face this now.

[Chorus:] 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away.

[Chorus:] 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
I bleed it out 
Digging deeper just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
Just to throw it away 
I bleed it out.

I bleed it out! 
I bleed it out.


!Linkin Park - Part Of Me

Part of me won’t go away 
Everyday reminded how much I hate it 
Weighted against the consequences 
Can’t live without it so it’s senseless.
Wanna cut it out of my soul 
And just live with a gaping hole 
Take control of my life 
And wash out all the burnt taste.

I made the problems in the first place 
Hang my head low ’cause it’s part of me 
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me 
Heard of me the routine scar.

New cuts cover where the old ones are 
And now I’m sick of this 
I can’t stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade away on my sanity 
I rather not even be then the man that’s staring in the mirror through me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

[Chorus:] 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me.

It can’t be frightening if you’ve never felt it 
Once it’s been dealt with you feel like you’ve been touched by something angelic 
And then melted down into a pool of peace 
Cease to be the animal you used to be.

Remove the broken parts you know were wrong 
And feel the karma when the problem’s all gone 
And then you start to see another piece of yourself that you can’t let be 
And that reason’ll last fight to free yourself.

Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well 
And now you know you can choose to lose the part in your heart 
Where your insides bruise 
You can live if you’re willing to 
Put a stop to just what’s killing you.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

Cut myself free willingly 
Stop just what’s killing me.

[Chorus:] 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me.

Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently 
Alive in me, inside of me, a part of me screams away silently.

This part of me won’t go away, part of me won’t go away..

Everywhere I look around I see how everyone aught to be 
Every time I see myself I see there’s always something wrong with me.

[Chorus:] 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me.

[Chorus:] 
I feel it everyday 
I feel I made my way 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside 
Swallowing me.

I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me. 
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside, swallowing me.


!Linkin Park - My December

This is my December 
This is my time of the year 
This is my December 
This is all so clear.
This is my December 
This is my snow covered home 
This is my December 
This is me alone.

And I 
[Just wish that I didn't feel Like there was something I missed] 
And I 
[Take back all the things I said To make you feel like that] 
And I 
[Just wish that I didn't feel Like there was something I missed] 
And I 
[Take back all the things I said to you].

[Chorus:] 
And I give it all away 
Just to have somewhere to go to 
Give it all away 
To have someone to come home to.

This is my December 
These are my snow covered dreams 
This is me pretending 
This is all I need.

And I 
[Just wish that I didn't feel Like there was something I missed] 
And I 
[Take back all the things I said To make you feel like that] 
And I 
[Just wish that I didn't feel Like there was something I missed] 
And I 
[Take back all the things I said to you].

[Chorus:] 
And I give it all away 
Just to have somewhere to go to 
Give it all away 
To have someone to come home to.

This is my December 
This is my time of the year 
This is my December 
This is all so clear.

[Chorus:] 
And I give it all away 
Just to have somewhere to go to 
Give it all away 
To have someone to come home to.


!Linkin Park - High Voltage

Just do something to tell you who I am, ya know?
[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

I’ve been taking into crates ever since I was livin’ in space 
Before the rat-race, before monkeys had human traits 
Mastered numerology and big-bang theology 
Preformed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology.

Invented the mic so I start blessin’ it 
And chin-checkin’ kids to make my point like an impressionist 
Many men have tried to shake us 
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I’m made of.

I buckle knees like leg braces 
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of the emcees that hate us 
So try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on 
From now to infinity let icons be bygones.

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this 
I’ve tried threats but moved on to a promise 
I stomp shit with or without an accomplish 
(Mixed media) 
The stamp of approval is on this.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

Akira, put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones 
Never satisfy my rhyme jones 
Sprayin’ bright day over what you might say 
Blood type carillon Technicolor type A.

On highways with road rage I’m patient to win 
The cage and the tin to bounce all around 
In surround sound devouring the scene 
Subliminal gangrene paintings.

Overall the same things sing songs karaoke copy madness 
Break bones verbally to sticks and stone tactics 
Fourth dimension, combat convention 
Write rhymes at ease while the tracks stand at attention (Attention). 

Meant to put you away with the pencil 
Pistol, official, 16 line rhyme missile 
Why you risk it all, I pick out of your flaws 
Spin, blah-blah-blah-blah 
You can say you saw.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

[Chorus:] 
It’s high voltage you can’t shake the shock 
Because nobody wants it to stop, check it out.

!Linkin Park - Carousel

She can’t hide no matter how hard she tries 
Her secret disguise behind her lies 
And at night she cries away her pride 
With eyes shut tight, staring at her inside.
All her friends know why she can’t sleep at night 
All her family asking if she’s all right 
All she wants to do is get rid of this hell 
But all she’s gotta do is stop kidding herself.

She can only fool herself for so long 
She can only fool herself for so long 
She can only fool herself for so long 
She can only fool herself.

[Chorus:] 
I’m too weak to face me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.

When it comes to how to live his life 
He can’t be told 
Says he’s got it all under control 
Thinks he knows it’s not a problem he’s stuck with 
But in reality, it’d be a problem to just quit.

An addict and he can’t hold the reigns 
The pain is worse ’cause his friends have it the same 
Tries to slow down the problem he’s got 
But can’t get off the carousel 
Until he makes it stop.

He can only fool himself for so long 
He can only fool himself for so long 
He can only fool himself for so long 
He can only fool himself.

[Chorus:] 
I’m too weak to face me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.

Try to fly with the wings I gave you 
Try to do what you believe and I’ll save you.

Try to fly with the wings I gave you 
Try to do what you believe and I’ll save you.

[Chorus:] 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.

[Chorus:] 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.

[Chorus:] 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.

[Chorus:] 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me 
I never know just why you run 
So far away, far away from me.


!Linkin Park - And One

Where should I start 
Disjointed heart 
I’ve got no commitment 
To my own flesh and blood.
Left all alone 
Far from my home 
No one to hear me 
To heal my ill heart, I ...

Keep it locked up inside 
Cannot express 
To the point I’ve regressed 
If anger’s a gift, then I guess I’ve been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside 
Keep my distance from your lies. 
Cannot express 
To the point I’ve regressed 
If anger’s a gift, then I guess I’ve been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside 
Keep my distance from your lies.

It’s too late to love me now 
You helped me to show me 
It’s too late to love me now 
You don’t take a word in.

Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break) 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me) 
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too) 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.

Keep it locked up inside 
Keep my distance from your lies.

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break) 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me) 
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too) 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.

Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace 
Breaking a part of my heart to find release 
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace.

Keep my distance 
Keep my distance 
Keep my distance 
Keep my distance.

Spit drips in the jar, the witless, witness 
Cryptic code, realism shifts your mystic 
Dark all I do embark the shadows, 
Involved with my thought catalogue, analogue, rap catalogue.

Keep my distance, answer your resistance, hurt by persistance, 
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste 
And I’m forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being 
Feeling the weightlessness pressing between the ceiling, reeling around room.

Riding a bubble of sound proof, it’s the frequency making you 
Shake-shake with every boom 
Involuntary muscle contraction, ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria 
The sound counts to make the dead flush to have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff.


!Linkin Park - Faint

I am 
A little bit of loneliness 
A little bit of disregard 
A handful of complaints 
But I can’t help the fact 
That everyone can see these scars.
I am 
What I want you to want 
What I want you to feel 
But it’s like 
No matter what I do 
I can’t convince you 
To just believe this is real.

So I let go 
Watching you 
Turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I’m not 
But I’ll be here 
’Cause you’re all that I got.

[Chorus:] 
I can’t feel 
The way I did before 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored 
Time won’t heal 
This damage anymore 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored.

I am 
A little bit insecure 
A little unconfident 
’Cause you don’t understand 
I do what I can 
But sometimes I don’t make sense.

I am 
What you never want to say 
But I’ve never had a doubt 
It’s like no matter what I do 
I can’t convince you 
For once just to hear me out.

So I let go 
Watching you 
Turn your back like you always do 
Face away and pretend that I’m not 
But I’ll be here 
’Cause you’re all that I got.

[Chorus:] 
I can’t feel 
The way I did before 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored 
Time won’t heal 
This damage anymore 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored.

No!!! 
Hear me out now 
You’re gonna listen to me 
Like it or not 
Right now 
Hear me out now 
You’re gonna listen to me 
Like it or not 
Right now!

[Chorus:] 
I can’t feel 
The way I did before 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored 
I can’t feel 
The way I did before 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored 
Time won’t heal 
This damage anymore 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored.

I can’t feel 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored 
Time won’t heal 
Don’t turn your back on me 
I won’t be ignored.


!Linkin Park - Figure.09

Nothing ever stops all these thoughts 
And the pain attached to them 
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening 
It’s like nothing I can do 
Will distract me when 
I think of how I shot myself in the back again 
’Cause from the infinite words I could say 
I put all the pain you gave to me on display 
But didn’t realize 
Instead of setting it free 
I took what I hated and made it a part of me.
[It never goes away] never goes away ...

[Chorus:] 
And now ... 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be right here 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be my fear 
I can’t separate myself from 
What I’ve done 
Giving up a part of me 
I’ve let myself become you!

Hearing your name, the memories 
Come back again 
I remember when it started happening 
I’d see you in every thought I had and then 
The thoughts slowly found words 
Attached to them 
And I knew as they escaped away 
I was committing myself to them 
And every day I 
Regret saying those things 
’Cause now I see, that I ... 
Took what I hated and made it a part of me.

[It never goes away] never goes away...

[Chorus:] 
And now ... 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be right here 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be my fear 
I can’t separate myself from 
What I’ve done 
Giving up a part of me 
I’ve let myself become you!

[It never goes away] 
Never goes away 
Never goes away 
Never goes away.

Get away from me! 
Gimme my space back 
You gotta just go 
Everything comes down to memories of you 
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know 
I’ve let you go 
So get away from me 
Gimme my space back 
You gotta just go 
Everything comes down to memories of you 
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know 
I’ve let you go, go...

[Chorus:] 
And now ... 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be right here 
You’ve become a part of me 
You’ll always be my fear 
I can’t separate myself from 
What I’ve done 
Giving up a part of me 
I’ve let myself become you!

I’ve let myself become you 
I’ve let myself become lost inside these 
Thoughts of you 
Giving up a part of me 
I’ve let myself become you!


!Linkin Park - Hit The Floor

There are just too many 
Times that people 
Have tried to look inside of me 
Wondering what I think of you 
And I protect you out of courtesy.
Too many times that I’ve 
Held on when I needed to push away 
Afraid to say what was on my mind 
Afraid to say what I need to say.

Too many things 
That you’ve said about me 
When I’m not around 
You think having the upper hand 
Means you’ve got to keep putting me down.

But I’ve had too many stand-offs with you 
It’s about as much as I can stand 
So I’m waiting until the upper hand 
Is mine.

[Chorus:] 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won...

And then it’s all gone!

So many people like me 
Put so much trust in all your lies 
So concerned with what you think 
To just say what we feel inside.

So many people like me 
Walk on eggshells all day long 
All I know is that all I want 
Is to feel like I’m not stepped on.

There are so many things you say 
That make me feel like you’ve crossed the line 
What goes up will surely fall 
And I’m counting down the time.

’Cause I’ve had so many stand-offs with you 
It’s about as much as I can stand 
So I’m waiting until the upper hand 
Is mine.

[Chorus:] 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won...

And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone 
Now it’s all gone.

I know I’ll never trust a single thing you say 
You knew your lies would divide us 
But you lied anyway 
And all the lies have got you floating 
Up above us all 
But what goes up has got to fall.

[Chorus:] 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Watch it drop 
Making your heart stop 
Just before you hit the floor 
One minute you’re on top 
The next you’re not 
Missed your shot 
Making your heart stop 
You think you won...

And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone 
And then it’s all gone.

Now it’s all gone!


!Linkin Park - Lying From You

When I pretend 
Everything is what I want it to be 
I look exactly like what you had always 
Wanted to see 
When I pretend 
I can forget about the criminal I am 
Stealing second after second just ’cause 
I know I can/But 
I can’t pretend this is the way 
It will stay/I’m just 
Trying to bend the truth 
I can’t pretend I’m who you want me to be 
So I’m.
Lying my way from you!

[Chorus:] 
[No, no turning back now] 
I wanna be pushed aside 
So let me go 
[No, no turning back now] 
Let me take back my life 
I’d rather be all alone 
[No turning back now] 
Anywhere on my own 
’Cause I can see 
[No, no turning back now] 
The very worst part of you 
Is me.

I remember what they taught to me 
Remember condescending talk 
Of who I ought to be 
Remember listening to all of that 
And this again 
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in 
And now you think this person 
Really is me and I’m 
[Trying to bend the truth] 
But the more I push 
The more I’m pulling away 
’Cause I’m 
Lying my way from you!

[Chorus:] 
[No, no turning back now] 
I wanna be pushed aside 
So let me go 
[No, no turning back now] 
Let me take back my life 
I’d rather be all alone 
[No turning back now] 
Anywhere on my own 
’Cause I can see 
[No, no turning back now] 
The very worst part of you 
The very worst part of you 
Is me.

This isn’t what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said 
Would have you running from me 
Like this.

This isn’t what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said 
Would have you running from me 
Like this.

This isn’t what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said 
Would have you running from me 
Like this.

This isn’t what I wanted to be 
I never thought that what I said 
Would have you running from me 
Like this.

[Chorus:] 
[No, no turning back now] 
I wanna be pushed aside 
So let me go 
[No, no turning back now] 
Let me take back my life 
I’d rather be all alone 
[No turning back now] 
Anywhere on my own 
’Cause I can see 
[No/no turning back now] 
The very worst part of you 
The very worst part of you 
Is me.


!Linkin Park - Somewhere I Belong

When this began 
I had nothing to say 
And I’d get lost in the nothingness inside of me 
I was confused 
And I let it all out to find /that I’m 
Not the only person with these things in mind 
Inside of me 
But all the vacancy the words revealed 
Is the only real thing that I’ve got left to feel 
Nothing to lose 
Just stuck/hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
And the fault is my own.
[Chorus:] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I’ve held so long 
[Erase all the pain ’til it’s gone] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
Like I’m close to something real 
I want to find something i’ve wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong.

And I’ve got nothing to say 
I can’t believe I didn’t fall right down on my face 
I was confused 
Looking everywhere, only to find that it’s 
Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind 
So what am I 
What do I have but negativity 
’Cause I can’t justify the 
Way everyone is looking at me 
Nothing to lose 
Nothing to gain/hollow and alone 
And the fault is my own 
The fault is my own.

[Chorus:] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I’ve held so long 
[Erase all the pain ’til it’s gone] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
Like I’m close to something real 
I want to find something i’ve wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong.

I will never know 
Myself until I do this on my own 
And I will never feel 
Anything else until my wounds are healed 
I will never be 
Anything ’til I break away from me 
And I will break away 
I’ll find myself today.

[Chorus:] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
What I thought was never real 
I want to let go of the pain I’ve held so long 
[Erase all the pain ’til it’s gone] 
I want to heal 
I want to feel 
Like I’m close to something real 
I want to find something i’ve wanted all along 
Somewhere I belong.

I want to heal 
I want to feel like I’m 
Somewhere i belong 
I want to heal 
I want to feel like I’m 
Somewhere i belong 
Somewhere i belong.


!Linkin Park - Easier To Run

[Chorus:] 
It’s easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It’s so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone.
Something has been taken 
From deep inside of me 
A secret I’ve kept locked away 
No one can ever see 
Wounds so deep they never show 
They never go away 
Like moving pictures in my head 
For years and years they’ve played.

If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could ... 
Stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would.

If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could ... 
Stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all my shame to the grave.

[Chorus:] 
It’s easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It’s so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone.

Sometimes I remember 
The darkness of my past 
Bringing back these memories 
I wish I didn’t have 
Sometimes I think of letting go 
And never looking back 
And never moving forward so 
There would never be a past.

If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could ... 
Stand up and take the blame I would 
If I could take all the shame to the grave I would.

If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could ... 
Stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all my shame to the grave

Just washing it aside 
All of the helplessness inside 
Pretending I don’t feel misplaced 
Is so much simpler than change.

[Chorus:] 
It’s easier to run 
Replacing this pain with something numb 
It’s so much easier to go 
Than face all this pain here all alone.

It’s easier to run 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made...

It’s easier to go 
If I could change I would 
Take back the pain I would 
Retrace every wrong move that I made I would 
If I could ... 
Stand up and take the blame I would 
I would take all my shame to the grave!


!Linkin Park - Don't Stay

Sometimes I ... 
Need to remember just to breathe 
Sometimes I ... 
Need you to stay away from me 
Sometimes I’m ... 
In disbelief I didn’t know 
Somehow I ... 
Need you to go!
[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay! 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
(Just give me myself back and)

[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay! 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
[Just give me myself back and] 
Don’t stay!

Sometimes I 
Feel like I trusted you too well 
Sometimes I 
Just feel like screaming at myself 
Sometimes I’m 
In disbelief I didn’t know 
Somehow I 
Need to be alone!

[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
(Just give me myself back and).

[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
(Just give me myself back and) 
Don’t stay!

I don’t need you anymore 
I don’t want to be ignored 
I don’t need one more day 
Of you wasting me away.

I don’t need you anymore 
I don’t want to be ignored 
I don’t need one more day 
Of you wasting me away 
With no apologies.

[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
What you were changing me into 
(Just give me myself back and).

[Chorus:] 
Don’t stay 
Forget our memories 
Forget our possibilities 
Take all your faithlessness with you 
(Just give me myself back and). 
Don’t stay!

Don’t stay! 
Don’t stay!


!Linkin Park - Breaking The Habit

Memories consume 
Like opening the wound 
I’m picking me apart again 
You all assume 
I’m safe here in my room 
Unless I try to start again.
I don’t want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
’Cause inside I realize 
That I’m the one confused.

[Chorus:] 
I don’t know what’s worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don’t know why I instigate 
And say what I don’t mean 
I don’t know how I got this way 
I know it’s not alright 
So I’m ... 
Breaking the habit 
I’m breaking the habit 
Tonight!

Clutching my cure 
I tightly lock the door 
I try to catch my breath again 
I hurt much more 
Than anytime before 
I had no options left again.

I don’t want to be the one 
The battles always choose 
’Cause inside I realize 
That I’m the one confused.

[Chorus:] 
I don’t know what’s worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
I don’t know why I instigate 
And say what I don’t mean 
I don’t know how I got this way 
I’ll never be alright 
So I’m ... 
Breaking the habit 
I’m breaking the habit 
Tonight!

I’ll paint it on the walls 
’Cause I’m the one at fault 
I’ll never fight again 
And this is how it ends.

[Chorus:] 
I don’t know what’s worth fighting for 
Or why I have to scream 
But now I have some clarity 
To show you what I mean 
I don’t know how I got this way 
I’ll never be alright 
So I’m ... 
Breaking the habit.

Breaking the habit. 
Breaking the habit ... 
Tonight!


!Linkin Park - Runaway

Graffiti decorations 
Under a sky of dust 
A constant wave of tension 
On top of broken trust.
The lessons that you taught me 
I learn were never true 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger at me again.

[Chorus:] 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind.

Paper bags and angry voices 
Under a sky of dust 
Another wave of tension 
Has more than filled me up.

All my talk of taking action 
These words were never true 
Now I find myself in question 
They point the finger at me again 
Guilty by association 
You point the finger at me again.

[Chorus:] 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind.

I gonna run away and never say GOODBYE! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away.

I gonna run away and never wonder WHY! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away.

I gonna run away and open up my MIND ! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away 
MIND ! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away 
MIND ! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away 
MIND ! 
Gonna run away / Gonna run away.

[Chorus:] 
I wanna run away 
Never say goodbye 
I wanna know the truth 
Instead of wondering why 
I wanna know the answers 
No more lies 
I wanna shut the door 
And open up my mind.

I wanna run away 
And open up my mind.

I wanna run away 
And open up my mind.

I wanna run away 
And open up my mind.

I wanna run away 
And open up my mind!


!Linkin Park - Points Of Authority

Forfeit the game before somebody else 
Takes you out of the frame puts your name to shame 
Cover up your face you can't run the race 
The pace is too fast you just won't last.
You love the way I look at you 
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through 
You take away if I give in 
My life, my pride is broken.

[Chorus:] 
You like to think you're never wrong 
(You leave what you've got) 
You have to act like you're someone

You want someone to hurt like you 
(You leave what you've got) 
You want to share what you've been through 
(To leave what you've got).

You love the things I say I'll do, 
The way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you

!Linkin Park - Pushing Me Away

I’ve lied to you 
The same way that I always do 
This is the last smile 
That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you.
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie ... 
(Everything has to end, you’ll soon find we’re out of time left to watch it all unwind) 
The sacrifice is never knowing!

[Chorus:] 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away.

[Chorus:] 
Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away.

I’ve tried like you 
To do everything you wanted too 
This is the last time 
I’ll take the blame for the sake of being with you.

(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down) 
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie ...

The sacrifice is never knowing.

Why I never walked away 
Why I played myself this way 
Now I see your testing me pushes me away.

Pushes me away! 
Pushes me away!

!Linkin Park - Papercut

Why does it feel like night today? 
Something in here's not right today 
Why am I so uptight today? 
Paranoia's all I got left. 

I don't know what stressed me first 
Or how the pressure was fed 
But I know just what it feels like 
To have a voice in the back of my head.
It's like a face that I hold inside 
A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time I lie 
A face that laughs every time I fall.

(And watches everything) 
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is hearing me 
Right underneath my skin.

[Chorus:] 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.

I know I've got a face in me 
Points out all my mistakes to me 
You've got a face on the inside too and 
Your paranoia's probably worse.

I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand 
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is 
I can't add up to what you can but 
Everybody has a face that they hold inside.

A face that awakes when I close my eyes 
A face watches every time they lie 
A face that laughs every time they fall 
(And watches everything).

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim 
That the face inside is watching you too 
Right inside your skin.

[Chorus:] 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Chorus:] 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin (3x)

The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me

The sun goes down 
I feel the light betray me 
(The sun..)

[Chorus:] 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
(I feel the light betray me) 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin 
(The sun..)

[Chorus:] 
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back 
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head 
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
(I feel the light betray me) 
It's like / I can't stop what I'm hearing within.

(The sun..) 
It's like / I can't stop what I'm hearing within 
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin.


!Linkin Park - With You

I woke up in a dream today 
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor 
Forgot all about yesterday 
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore 
A little taste of hypocrisy 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake slow to react 
Even though you're so close to me 
You're still so distant And I can't bring you back.
[Chorus:] 
It's true the way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you're not with me 
I'm with you 
You Now I see keeping everything inside 
(With you) 
You Now I see Even when I close my eyes.

I hit you and you hit me back 
We fall to the floor the rest of the day stands still 
Fine line between this and that 
When things go wrong I pretend the past isn't real 
Now I’m trapped in this memory 
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake slow to react 
So even though you're close to me 
You're still so distant And I can't bring you back.

[Chorus:] 
It's true the way I feel 
Was promised by your face 
The sound of your voice 
Painted on my memories 
Even if you're not with me 
I'm with you 
You Now I see keeping everything inside 
(With you) 
You Now I see Even when I close my eyes.

No matter how far we’ve come 
I can’t wait to see tomorrow. 
No matter how far we’ve come 
I can’t wait to see tomorrow.

With you 
You Now I see keeping everything inside 
With you 
You Now I see Even when I close my eyes.

With you 
You Now I see keeping everything inside 
With you 
You Now I see Even when I close my eyes.


!Linkin Park - One Step Closer

I cannot take this anymore 
I'm saying everything I've said before 
All these words they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Less I hear the less you'll say 
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before...

[Chorus:] 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break.

I find the answers aren't so clear 
Wish I could find a way to disappear 
All these thoughts they make no sense 
I find bliss in ignorance 
Nothing seems to go away 
Over and over again.

Just like before...

[Chorus:] 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break.

[Chorus:] 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to ... break.

Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up, Shut up, Shut up 
Shut up when I'm talking to you 
Shut up, Shut up, Shut up 
Shut up, I'm about to break.

[Chorus:] 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break.

[Chorus:] 
Everything you say to me 
Takes me one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to break 
I need a little room to breathe 
Cause I'm one step closer to the edge 
And I'm about to ... break.


!Linkin Park - In The End

It starts with one thing 
I don’t know why 
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try 
keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time.
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away.

It’s so unreal 
Didn’t look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but didn’t even know 
Wasted it all just to watch you go! 
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when.

[Chorus:] 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter.

One thing, I don’t know why 
It doesn’t even matter how hard you try 
keep that in mind 
I designed this rhyme, to remind myself how.

I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me.

I’m surprised it got so (far) 
Things aren’t the way they were before 
You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then.

But it all comes back to me (in the end) 
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when.

[Chorus:] 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter.

I’ve put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There’s only one thing you should know.

I’ve put my trust in you 
Pushed as far as I can go 
And for all this 
There’s only one thing you should know.

[Chorus:] 
I tried so hard 
And got so far 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter 
I had to fall 
To lose it all 
But in the end 
It doesn’t even matter.


!Linkin Park - Forgotten

[Chorus:] 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care.
[Chorus:] 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care.

There's a place so dark you can't see the end 
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend 
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions 
Forcefully, the power of suggestion 
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust 
A spot of light floods the floor 
And pours over the rusted world of pretend 
And the eyes ease open and its dark again.

[Chorus:] 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care.

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up.

Moving all around 
Screaming of the ups and downs 
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound 
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps past the 
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete 
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn 
Floats on down the street till the wind is gone 
And the memory now is like the picture was then 
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again.

[Chorus:] 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care.

[Chorus:] 
From the top to the bottom 
Bottom to top I stop 
At the core I've forgotten 
In the middle of my thoughts 
Taken far from my safety 
The picture is there 
The memory won't escape me 
But why should I care.

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up.

Now you got me caught in the act 
You bring the thought back 
I'm telling you that ...

I see it right through you (7x)

In the memory you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up.

In the memory / you'll find me 
Eyes burning up 
The darkness holding me tightly 
Until the sun rises up.


!Linkin Park - Crawling

[Chorus:] 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds / they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real.
There’s something inside me that pulls beneath the surface 
Consuming / confusing 
This lack of self control I fear is never ending 
Controlling / I can’t seem 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
(Without a sense of confidence / I’m convinced 
That there's just too much pressure to take) 
I’ve felt this way before 
So insecure.

[Chorus:] 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds / they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real.

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me 
Distracting / reacting 
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection 
It’s haunting how I can’t seem 
To find myself again 
My walls are closing in 
(Without a sense of confidence / I’m convinced 
That there's just too much pressure to take) 
I’ve felt this way before 
So insecure.

[Chorus:] 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds / they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing what is real.

[Chorus:] 
Crawling in my skin 
These wounds / they will not heal 
Fear is how I fall 
Confusing, confusing what is real.

There’s something inside me that pulls beneath the surface 
Consuming 
Confusing what is real 
This lack of self control I fear is never ending 
Controlling ... 
Confusing what is real.


!Linkin Park - By My Head

What do I do to ignore them behind me? 
Do I follow my instincts blindly? 
Do I hide my pride / from these bad dreams 
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? 
Do I / sit here and try to stand it? 
Or do I / try to catch them red – handed? 
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness, 
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? 
Because I can’t hold on / when I’m stretched so thin 
I make the right moves but I’m lost within 
I put on my daily facade but then 
I just end up getting hurt again.
[Chorus:] 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can’t rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can’t rely on myself.

I can’t hold on 
To what I want when I’m stretched so thin 
It’s all too much to take in 
I can’t hold on 
To anything watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

If I Turn my back I’m defenseless 
And to go blindly seems senseless 
If I hide my pride and let it all go on / then they’ll 
Take from me ‘till everything is gone 
If I let them go I’ll be outdone 
But if I try to catch them I’ll be outrun 
If I’m killed by the questions like a cancer 
Then I’ll be buried in the silence of the answer.

[Chorus:] 
By myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can’t rely on myself (myself) 
I ask why, but in my mind 
I find I can’t rely on myself.

I can’t hold on 
To what I want when I’m stretched so thin 
It’s all too much to take in 
I can’t hold on 
To anything watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

How do you think / I’ve lost so much 
I’m so afraid / I’m out of touch 
How do you expect / I will know what to do 
When all I know / Is what you tell me to.

Don’t you (know) 
I can’t tell you how to make it (go) 
No matter what I do, how hard I (try) 
I can’t seem to convince myself (why) 
I’m stuck on the outside.

Don’t you [know] 
I can’t tell you how to make it (go) 
No matter what I do, how hard I (try) 
I can’t seem to convince myself (why) 
I’m stuck on the outside.

I can’t hold on 
To what I want when I’m stretched so thin 
It’s all too much to take in 
I can’t hold on 
To anything watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in.

I can’t hold on 
To what I want when I’m stretched so thin 
It’s all too much to take in 
I can’t hold on 
To anything watching everything spin 
With thoughts of failure sinking in.


!Linkin Park - A Place For My Head

I watch how the moon sits in the sky 
On a dark night shining with the light from the sun 
The sun doesn't give light to the moon 
Assuming the moon's going to owe it one 
It makes me think of how you act to me 
You do favors and then rapidly 
You just turn around and start asking me about 
Things that you want back from me.
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest.

[Chorus] 
I wanna to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
(You'll see it's not meant to be) 
I wanna to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head.

Maybe someday I'll be just like you, and 
Step on people like you do and 
Run away the people I thought I knew 
I remember back then who you were 
You used to be calm, used to be strong 
Used to be generous, but you should've known 
That you'd wear out your welcome 
Now you see how quiet it is, all alone.

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest.

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest.

[Chorus] 
I wanna to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
(You'll see it's not meant to be) 
I wanna to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head.

You try to take the best of me / go away (8x)

[Chorus] 
I wanna to be in another place 
I hate when you say you don't understand 
(You'll see it's not meant to be) 
I wanna to be in the energy, not with the enemy 
A place for my head.

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest.

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger 
Sick of you acting like I owe you this 
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest.


!Кай Метов - Вспомни меня

О, е, вот ты где радость моя, 
Как я рад повстречать снова тебя 
Есть такая нынче тема 
Позабыть про все проблемы, 
Позабыть про все дела, 
Только ты, только я
[Chorus:] 
Вспомни меня, ты вспомни меня 
Пусть взойдёт на небе наша звезда, 
Вспомни как горел закат, 
Как кружился листопад 
Нам с тобой не так давно вместе было хорошо 
Ты будешь моей, только моей, тысячи раз, 
Ты будешь моей, только моей, тысячи раз.

О, е, вот ты где солнце моё 
Нам с тобой сегодня будет очень хорошо 
Подойди ко мне поближе, 
Чтоб тебя я лучше слышал 
Посмотри в мои глаза, 
Только ты, только я!

Вспомни меня, ты вспомни меня 
Пусть взойдёт на небе наша звезда,

Ты будешь моей, только моей, тысячи раз, 
Ты будешь моей, только моей, тысячи раз!

Вспомни меня, ты вспомни меня 
Пусть взойдёт на небе наша звезда 
Вспомни меня, ты вспомни меня, 
Вспомни меня, ты вспомни меня 
Пусть взойдёт на небе наша звезда 
Вспомни меня.

Хорошо нам жить в стране советов. 
Нам любое дело по плечу. 
Мама, я хочу быть пионером! 
Пионером, мама, быть хочу!


!Кай Метов - Position №2

Position number one - отдыхаю сам 
Position number two - тебя хочу. 
Я знаю точно, знаю наверняка 
Сегодня вторник и ты дома одна 
И я тебе звоню, position number 2.
[Chorus:] 
Я не могу, не могу продолжать этот путь 
Я так устал, так устал, я хочу отдохнуть 
И я звоню, говорю, как давно я тебя не видел. 
Ты расскажи мне где ты была? 
Ты расскажи мне как ты жила, что ты творила без меня?...

Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?! 
Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?!

Position number one - говоришь не дам 
Position number two - мол только ему. 
Да это верно, но подумай сама, 
Сегодня вторник, значит он это я 
И я тебя звоню - position number two!

[Chorus:] 
Я не могу, не могу больше видеть туман 
Я так устал, так устал, всюду ложь и обман. 
И я звоню, говорю, как давно я тебя не видел. 
Ты расскажи мне как ты сама, ты расскажи как твои дела?... 
Что ты творила без меня?

Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?! 
Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?!

Ты расскажи мне где ты была? 
Ты расскажи мне как ты жила? 
Что ты творила без меня?

Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?! 
Милая моя, где ты ? Милая моя, где ты?!

Милая моя, где ты ?!


!София Ротару - Лаванда

Музыка - В. Матецкий 
Слова - М. Шабров.

В нашей жизни все бывает. 
И под солнцем лед не тает, 
И теплом зима встречает – 
Дождь идет в декабре.

Любим или нет – не знаем, 
Мы порой в любовь играем, 
А когда ее теряем, 
“Не судьба”, - говорим.

[Chorus:] 
Лаванда, горная лаванда – 
Наших встреч с тобой синие цветы. 
Лаванда, горная лаванда… 
Сколько лет прошло, но помним я и ты.

Лето нам тепло дарило, 
Чайка над волной парила, 
Только нам луна светила 
Нам одним на земле.

Но куда ушло все это? 
Не было, и нет ответа. 
И теперь как две планеты 
Мы с тобой далеки.

[Chorus:] 
Лаванда, горная лаванда – 
Наших встреч с тобой синие цветы. 
Лаванда, горная лаванда… 
Сколько лет прошло, но помним я и ты.

[Chorus:] 
Лаванда, горная лаванда – 
Наших встреч с тобой синие цветы. 
Лаванда, горная лаванда… 
Сколько лет прошло, но помним я и ты.


!София Ротару - Хуторянка

Музыка - В. Матецкий 
Слова - М. Шабров 

Слышу старой песни мотив, 
Что сама напевала не раз, 
И глаза закрываю на миг, забыв, 
Что я городская сейчас. 
Эта песня, синий простор, 
Край родимый напомнила мне 
И девчонку ту, что с недавних пор 
Часто вижу я во сне.

[Chorus:] 
Хуто-хуторянка, девчоночка-смуглянка. 
Мне бы хоть разок, всего лишь на чуток 
В мою весну на хуторок. 
(2 раза)

Медом дышит лунная ночь. 
Редкий свет из окошек домов. 
И так хочется снова сорваться прочь 
В сиреневый рай садов.

Чтобы кругом опять голова 
И слова как хмельное вино, 
Чтобы ночь была - не расти трава, 
Любишь, губишь, все равно.

[Chorus:] 
Хуто-хуторянка, девчоночка-смуглянка. 
Мне бы хоть разок, всего лишь на чуток 
В мою весну на хуторок. 
(4 раза)

Хуто-хуторянка, девчонка-молдаванка. 
Мне бы хоть разок всего лишь на чуток 
В мою весну на хуторок.

Мне бы хоть разок всего лишь на чуток 
В мою весну на хуторок 
В мою весну на хуторок.

Ти признайся менi, 
Звiдки в тебе тi чари? 
Я без тебе всi днi 
У полонi печалi. 
Може, десь у лiсах 
Ти чар-зiлля шукала, 
Сонце - руту знайшла 
І мене зчарувала.

[Chorus:] 
Червону руту не шукай вечорами 
Ти у мене едина, тiльки ти, повiр! 
Бо твоя врода - то є чистая вода, 
То є бистрая вода з синiх гiр.

Бачу я тебе в снах 
У дiбровах зелених, 
По забутих стежках 
Ти приходиш до мене. 
I не треба нести 
Менi квітку надії, 
Бо давно уже ти 
Увiйшла в мої мрiї.

[Chorus:] 
Червону руту не шукай вечорами 
Ти у мене едина, тiльки ти, повiр! 
Бо твоя врода - то є чистая вода,

!София Ротару - А музыка звучит
Слова - Н. Зиновьев 


Рано опустело все в осеннем старом парке городском. 
Встретились случайно мы под чертовым, счастливым колесом. 
Музыка негромкая знакомая летит со всех сторон, 
Только вот судьба у нас с тобою несмешной аттракцион.
[Chorus:] 
А музыка звучит, как разлуки стон. 
Это старый вальс, осенний сон, 
Сквозь года, даже сквозь года 
Сердце обжигает грустью он.

А музыка звучит, музыка звучит. 
И слезы за улыбкой прячишь ты! 
Не грусти и за все прости, 
На краю не збывшейся мечты.

Где-то в одиночестве колдует репродуктор вдалеке. 
Вновь как прежде сердце мое тянется отчаянно к тебе. 
Стихла, отгуляла листопада золотая канитель, 
Но не откружила нашей жизни и надежды карусель.

[Chorus:] 
А музыка звучит, как разлуки стон. 
Это старый вальс, осенний сон, 
Сквозь года, даже сквозь года 
Сердце обжигает грустью он.

А музыка звучит, музыка звучит. 
И слезы за улыбкой прячишь ты! 
Не грусти и за все прости, 
На краю не збывшейся мечты.

[Chorus:] 
А музыка звучит, как разлуки стон. 
Это старый вальс, осенний сон, 
Сквозь года, даже сквозь года

И слезы за улыбкой прячишь ты! 
Не грусти и за все прости,

!София Ротару - Осень


Музыка - И. Поклода 
Слова - Г. Татарченко 


Слова на ветер не бросай напрасно 
И мне чудес не обещай напрасно. 
Когда идет осенний дождь, обратно лето не вернешь, 
Но разве чем-то нехорош осенний дождь?
[Chorus:] 
Расплескалась осень по земле, 
Разлилась в душе моей отрада. 
Если сны твои теперь не обо мне, 
Значит лето, значит лето. 
Значит лето вспоминать не надо.

Не верь несбыточной мечте напрасно, 
Не верь обманчивой звезде напрасно. 
Жизнь не бывает без потерь, 
Но отвори удаче дверь, 
И песне той, что я пою, прошу, поверь.

[Chorus:] 
Расплескалась осень по земле, 
Разлилась в душе моей отрада. 
Если сны твои теперь не обо мне, 
Значит лето, значит лето. 
Значит лето вспоминать не надо.

!София Ротару - Я ж его любила

Музыка и слова: Константин Меладзе


А я не знала, что не вылечить временем, 
Не укрыть снегопадами – в моем сердце печаль. 
А я не знала, что любовь моя прежняя 
Оживет так негаданно, вновь его повстречав.
[Chorus:] 
Я же его любила, а он меня не простил, 
Тенью за ним ходила, а он меня не впустил, 
Ночи ему дарила, нежней, чем розовый шелк, 
Я же его любила, а он меня не нашел! 
(A он меня не нашел!)

Не миновала я пути неизбежного, 
Любовалась закатами, не спала по ночам, 
А я не знала, что любовь моя прежняя 
Оживет так негаданно, вновь его повстречав.

[Chorus:] 
Я же его любила, а он меня не простил, 
Тенью за ним ходила, а он меня не впустил, 
Ночи ему дарила, нежней, чем розовый шелк, 
Я же его любила, а он меня не нашел! 
(A он меня не нашел!)

!Бумбокс - Вахтерам

Тебе не нравится дым и чёрт с ним 
Он убивает слова, кругом голова 
Уже разносит молва по дворам 
Что между нами чивава.
О чём с тобой говорить, потеряли нить 
Быть не собой перестать и дома спать 
Нас не измерить на глаз, а сейчас 
Зачем мы давим на тормоз, не на газ?

Вопрос извечный зачем да почему 
Я понемногу с ума, ты не сама 
А эти ночи в Крыму теперь кому 
Я если встречу потом передам ему.

Писклявый твой голосок как электрошок 
Что я бухой без вина твоя вина 
Теперь узнает страна до темна 
Им донесут обо всем на Fm волнах.

[Chorus:] 
Я помню белые обои, чёрная посуда 
Нас в хрущёвке двое, кто мы и откуда? 
Задвигаем шторы, кофеёк, плюшки стынут 
Объясните теперь нам, вахтёры, 
Почему я на ней так сдвинут?

Давай вот так просидим до утра 
Не уходи, погоди - но мне пора 
И если выход один впереди 
То почему мы то холод то жара?

Раскладывать по местам я устал 
И поворачивать вспять, ну вот опять 
Прикосновения плавили мой метал 
Ты элемент номер пять ни дать ни взять.

Идёт к финалу игра в этот раз 
А ты всё так же молчишь, я говорю 
Минут пятнадцать осталось до утра 
Не вызывай так словлю и свалю.

Попробуем всё подшить не ворошить 
Мобильные номера постирать 
А уходить не спросив нету сил 
Давай попробуем заново всё собрать.

[Chorus:] 
Белые обои, чёрную посуду 
Нас в хрущёвке двое, кто мы и откуда? 
Задвигаем шторы, кофеёк, плюшки стынут 
Объясните теперь нам, вахтёры, 
Почему я на ней так сдвинут?

[Chorus:] 
Я помню белые обои, чёрная посуда 
Нас в хрущёвке двое, кто мы и откуда? 
Задвигаем шторы, кофеёк, плюшки стынут 
Объясните теперь нам, вахтёры, 
Почему я на ней так сдвинут?

[Chorus:] 
Белые обои, чёрная посуда 
Нас в хрущёвке двое, кто мы и откуда? 
Задвигаем шторы, кофеёк, плюшки стынут 
Объясните теперь нам, вахтёры, 
Почему я на ней так сдвинут? 


!Britney Spears - Shadow

Your body is warm
But you are not
You give a little
Not a lot
You coup your love
Until we kiss
Youa're all I want
But not like this
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here.

[Chorus:]
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon.

Your body gives
But then holds back
The sun is bright
The sky is black
Can only be another sign
I cannot keep what isn't mine
Your laughter it lingers on
But you, you were almost gone.

[Chorus:]
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon
And leaving too soon.

How can I tell if you mean what you say
You say it so loud, but you sound far away
Maybe I had just a glimpse of your soul
Or was that your shadow I saw on the wall
I'm watching you disappear
But you, you were never here.

[Chorus:]
It's only your shadow
Never yourself
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Filling the room
Arriving too late
No, no, no ...

It's only your shadow
It's only your shadow
Nobody else
It's only your shadow
Arriving too late
And leaving too soon.

It's only your shadow ..
